# Simple Blockchain for a Fictional Cryptocurrency

This repository contains a simple implementation of a blockchain for a fictional cryptocurrency in Python.

## Overview

A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block. By using cryptographic hash functions, the blocks are securely linked together, ensuring the integrity and immutability of the data.

This Python implementation provides a basic blockchain structure with the ability to create blocks, add them to the chain, and validate the integrity of the chain.

## Features

- Creation of blocks with timestamps, transaction data, and hashes.
- Addition of blocks to the blockchain with automatic calculation of hashes.
- Validation of the blockchain's integrity by checking the correctness of each block's hash and previous block's hash.

## Usage

To use this blockchain implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-cryptocurrency-blockchain.git

Requirements
This blockchain implementation requires Python 3.x and the hashlib module, which is included in the Python standard library.

Limitations
Please note that this implementation is meant for educational purposes and is not production-ready. It lacks some of the advanced features and security measures found in real-world blockchain systems. Therefore, it should not be used for actual cryptocurrency transactions or sensitive data storage.
